# =============================================================================
# GitHub Actions - CodeQL Security Analysis (Reusable Workflow)
# =============================================================================
# Performs CodeQL security scanning.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Scheduled weekly scan (Wednesdays at 01:25 UTC)
#   - Called by other workflows via workflow_call
#
# Note: PR-triggered CodeQL runs through _prerequisites-pr.yml only,
#       so there is no pull_request trigger here to avoid duplicate scans.
